# Solar Battery Monitoring
Welcome to the github repository of the PV system battery State-of-Charge monitoring project.
Navigate over to the "Ressources and Help" section to view the final-year project report associated with this project alongside some useful information.

The batteryM folder contains the full program used for driving the electronic load and compensating for the peukert effect. Do take note of the 
commented parts since they are used for peukert compensation (but have not been used for discharge tests).
